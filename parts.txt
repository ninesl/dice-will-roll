notes
	shop/smith can make jewelry (rings, necklaces, etc) that give buffs. likely takes the slot of joker gems?
	-- NOITA inspiration, crafting wands??? need to find right balance between complexity/worth doing

	flow of gems
		mine gem/get reward from mining (scoring and rolling dice)
		gem has default/base ability (+2 gold per X, +1 to 2s, etc etc.)
		gem can be broken down into garnets
		gem types (shared with garnet) have toughnesses, amount of uses with jewelry and pips

		gems can break? TBD. maybe only certain ones can

		garnets AND gems can be modified
			tumbling
			polishing
			cut into shape (cushion, pear, marquise etc)

		garnets can be placed in to jewelry, certain gem types/cuts/modifications can change ability of ring
		garnets are placed into the pips of dice
			when garnet breaks (based off toughness) it will do a cool animation falling off

		mine gems, determine which ones to sell/keep, use money to modify and buy things from rolland
